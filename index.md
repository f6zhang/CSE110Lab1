**I love Swift**. *I also love Java.* ~~I also love C~~. ***No, no one loves C.***

I'd like to quote ~~my favorite~~ Professor:
> It's not rocket science, it is computer science.

And my favorite code in python (~~I'm sorry, but python is so good to use~~):
```
while (1):
    print("Hello world!")
```
