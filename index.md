**I love Swift**. *I also love Java.* ~~I also love C~~. ***No, no one loves C.***

I'd like to quote ~~my favorite~~ Professor:
> It's not rocket science, it is computer science.

And my favorite code in python (~~I'm sorry, but python is so good to use~~):
```
while (1):
    print("Hello world!")
```

Here is the list of languages that I dislike:
1. C
2. C+
3. C++
4. C+++

That's lame. Ok, let's do it again:
- C+++
- C++
- C+
- C

Beautiful. Now:
1. C
   - C+
     - C++
       - C+++

Ok, let's see what we can do

- [x] Tell a bad joke
- [ ] Go to the moon
- [ ] Make a nuclear power engine
- [ ] \(Optional) Summon C'Thun (~~or Saber~~)

@People_who_still_reading_this Thank you all for listening to my bad jokes.

Wait, am I only supposed to do anything above task list? Ok I am done.
